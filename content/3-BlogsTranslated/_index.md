Here will be the list, introducing the blogs that you have translated. For example:

### [Blog 1 - Windows 10 → Windows 11 Migration for Amazon WorkSpaces Personal](3.1-Blog1/)
Windows 10 Enterprise will end support on October 14, 2025, so WorkSpaces BYOL must migrate to Windows 11 and cannot import new Windows 10 images. Windows 11 requires TPM and Secure Boot, so a new WorkSpace must be created instead of upgrading directly. There are two ways to migrate: using the Migration API (fast, free but no rollback) or building a new Windows 11 infrastructure (more stable but more complex and resource-intensive). Careful planning, data backups, and proper profile management will ensure a smooth and secure transition.

### [Blog 2 - Real-time Data Dashboard from Database → AWS Cloud Data Warehouse](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog presents an end-to-end architecture for near-real-time change data transfer (CDC) from the source database to the AWS cloud data warehouse. The solution combines AWS DMS for change capture, Kinesis Data Streams for transmission, Redshift Serverless for storage and analytics, and QuickSight for real-time dashboarding. The entire process ensures that the source database is not affected while providing continuous data for BI and dashboarding. The result is a robust system that helps organizations track real-time activity and dynamically analyze data on AWS.
### [Blog 3 - Generative AI Customer Research – Opportunities for AWS Partners](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog introduces the second edition of the AWS Partner Generative AI Customer Study, which surveyed 1,000 customers from 10 countries and 24 industries to understand their application models, purchase journeys, and strategic needs. The results show that more than 90% of customers plan to work with AWS partners on Generative AI deployments in the next three years, and AI adoption is increasingly industry-specific rather than generic use cases. The report provides key insights into purchasing criteria, AI architecture, implementation challenges, and the role of partners in technology decisions. The study helps AWS partners align their strategies, solutions, value propositions, and expand their business opportunities in the context of rapid growth in Generative AI.
