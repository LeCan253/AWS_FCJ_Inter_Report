### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
During my time in the program, I felt that the working environment was very open and friendly. The team members were always willing to support me when I encountered difficulties, whether it was a technical issue or a small task. The working space was quite comfortable and created a sense of concentration. If there were more team bonding activities, the experience would be more complete.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor guides enthusiastically, always gives clear comments and explains thoroughly when I do not understand the problem. The admin team processes documents quickly, provides complete documents and always follows up to ensure I do not get stuck. What I like most is that the mentor encourages me to experiment and find solutions myself instead of giving me the answer right away.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The assigned tasks are directly related to the knowledge I learned at school, and at the same time, they also open up many new aspects that I have never been exposed to before. Thanks to that, I not only consolidate the theory but also learn more practical things.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During my internship, I was exposed to more professional working tools, familiarized myself with teamwork and internal communication processes. In addition, the mentor's sharing of career experiences helped me see my future direction more clearly.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The team culture is very positive. Everyone collaborates freely, respects each other, and always maintains a positive attitude towards work. When faced with urgent deadlines, the whole team works together to complete them. That makes me feel like I am not alone even though I am just an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company supports reasonable allowances and creates flexible conditions regarding time when I have a study schedule or personal problems. In addition, participating in internal training sessions also helps me learn more practical knowledge.
